# Programming-2
# Java Project

This project contains various exercises and tests in Java, covering topics such as chatbot creation, data manipulation without arithmetic operators, banking operations, and object-oriented programming concepts.

## üî® Project Features

### Exercise 1 - Chatbot
- **Description**: Creation of a chatbot that collects user information such as name, age, CPF, and password, and performs basic validations.
- **Functionality**: The chatbot interacts with the user and processes their responses to provide appropriate feedback.

### Exercise 2 - Multiplication and Power
- **Description**: Implements multiplication and power calculations without using direct arithmetic operators.
- **Functionality**: Uses loops to perform multiplication and power calculations, demonstrating alternatives to standard arithmetic operators.

### Quest 2 - Bank Account
- **Description**: Creation of a class to represent a bank account, with methods to print the balance and perform transfers.
- **Functionality**: Allows the creation of bank accounts and the execution of transfers between them, with basic balance validations.

### Quest 3 - Constructor in Object-Oriented Programming
- **Description**: Demonstrates the use of constructors in object-oriented programming with a class representing an Instagram profile.
- **Functionality**: Includes two constructors in the `Profile` class for initialization with and without parameters.

### Visual Example of the Project

**Note:** No visual examples are available for this project.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and Technologies Used

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project

To start the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Java is installed**:
    - [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) is required to run the project. You can check if it is already installed with:

      ```bash
      java -version
      ```

    - If not installed, download and install the recommended version.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Copy the repository URL and execute the following command in the terminal:

      ```bash
      git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
      ```

3. **Compile and Run the Java Files**:
    - Navigate to the project directory and compile the files with:

      ```bash
      javac src/*.java
      ```

    - Run the compiled files with:

      ```bash
      java src.App
      ```
